Design a professional, modern, and visually striking CV (resume) template that matches Google's official design language and user interface standards. This CV should reflect Google's Material Design principles and branding while maintaining clarity, functionality, and a tech-savvy appeal. The final layout must look like something a top tech company (e.g., Google, DeepMind, OpenAI) would expect from a young professional applying for AI and Cybersecurity roles.

🧩 Design Specifications
Aesthetic Style:
Based on Google’s Material Design — flat elements, clean edges, bold typefaces, and intuitive layout.

Color Scheme:
Use subtle hints of Google’s signature color palette (blue, red, yellow, green) for accents only (icons, section titles, small dividers, bullets) to maintain a minimal and professional look.

Typography:
Use sans-serif fonts such as Google Sans, Roboto, or Open Sans, with clear visual hierarchy (e.g., larger bold name header, slightly smaller section headers, readable body text).

Layout & Structure:

Full-width header section with name and contact links

2-column layout below: Left (primary content), Right (skills, projects, certificates)

Plenty of white space for readability

Visual balance across all sections

Light lines or shaded blocks to separate sections subtly

Icons can be used sparingly for contact info and skills

Output Ready:
The template should be fully printable (PDF) and also digital-view optimized (for websites or ATS systems).
